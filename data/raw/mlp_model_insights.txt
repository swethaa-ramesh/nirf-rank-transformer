3. KEY INSIGHTS
---------------
• PERCEPTION and RPC are the most critical factors for NIRF ranking
• The MLP model shows good predictive power for both score and rank
• Feature importance varies slightly between different methods
• Model can be used for ranking improvement recommendations

4. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR COLLEGES
------------------------------
• Focus on improving PERCEPTION scores through reputation building
• Enhance RPC (Research & Professional Practice) capabilities
• Maintain strong TLR (Teaching, Learning & Resources) scores
• Use the model to predict potential ranking improvements
